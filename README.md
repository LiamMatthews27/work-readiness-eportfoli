## 🎯 Select

The artefacts I chose show some of the key skills I’ve developed during my studies:

Communication – Creating professional documents like my resume, cover letter, and a comprehensive project report for "EntrepreNet" honed my ability to articulate complex ideas clearly. I learned to tailor my communication for different audiences, from writing technical project charters for stakeholders to presenting my own achievements to potential employers.

Teamwork & Leadership – The EntrepreNet project required me to define team roles and responsibilities using a RACI chart, ensuring clear accountability. This experience taught me how to structure collaboration effectively. I learned that successful teamwork relies on defined processes, mutual support, and shared ownership of deadlines to build trust and work efficiently.

Problem-Solving – My project report includes a detailed Risk Register and Quality Management Plan, showing my systematic approach to problem-solving. For EntrepreNet, I proactively identified potential issues like regulatory compliance and data breaches, and developed mitigation strategies. This reinforced that planning and structured analysis are essential for navigating complex challenges, whether in a software project or a team assignment.

Goal Setting & Project Planning – I created a full Project Schedule for EntrepreNet, including a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and an Agile Iteration Plan. This taught me how to break down a large, ambitious goal—like building a platform to verify SMEs—into manageable phases and sprints. This skill in setting clear, sequential goals was crucial for staying on track and managing my time during busy periods.

## 💭 Reflect

Each artefact represents a step forward in my personal and professional development:

Working in a group really pushed me out of my comfort zone. It helped me understand the importance of listening to others and taking responsibility. I also learned how to handle disagreements and stay focused on the goal.

One of the biggest things I’ve gained is the ability to recognise my own weaknesses. Through team discussions and feedback, I realised I needed to improve how I manage my time and speak up more in group settings. Knowing this helped me work on those areas and become more confident.

Reflecting on my experiences also helped me understand what I enjoy doing and what kind of work I want to do in the future. It’s made me more motivated and focused.

Overall, this process made me more aware of how I work, how I learn, and how I can keep improving — not just at uni, but also in the workplace.

## 🔗 Connect

This portfolio ties everything together into one cohesive story of growth:

When I look at all the artefacts together, I can clearly see how my skills and experiences link up. Each one connects to a part of my growth — from learning how to present myself professionally, to working better with others, and understanding my own strengths and weaknesses.

The resume and cover letter show that I’m preparing for the workplace. The teamwork project shows I can contribute to a group, communicate ideas, and handle challenges. The reflections helped me make sense of everything I’ve done, and the goals timeline connects it all by showing how I’ve moved forward step by step.

This portfolio brings everything together and tells my story. It shows not just what I’ve done, but who I’ve become along the way — someone more confident, self-aware, and ready to take on new challenges.

## 🧠 Conclusion

This e-portfolio is a snapshot of my readiness for the world of work. Through a combination of academic performance, technical experience, and personal growth, I have built a strong foundation for future opportunities.

I’m actively seeking:
- 🎓 Internship or graduate roles in software development or tech support
- 🌍 Opportunities to grow in a team environment
- 🚀 Challenges where I can apply my skills and continue learning
