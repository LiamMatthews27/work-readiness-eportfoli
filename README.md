## 🎯 Select

The artefacts I chose show some of the key skills I’ve developed during my studies:

Communication – Creating my resume and cover letter helped me explain who I am and what I’ve achieved in a professional way. It made me more confident in presenting myself to future employers.

Teamwork – Working in a team taught me how to share ideas, support others, and meet deadlines together. We had to rely on each other, and that helped us build trust and work efficiently.

Problem-Solving – The PowerPoint slides from our project show how we broke down tasks and came up with solutions. It reminded me how planning and brainstorming as a team makes tough problems easier to handle.This PowerPoint explains the goal of our assignment, which is to take a traditional restaurant setup that doesn’t use much technology and turn it into a modern web-based system. The idea is to help the restaurant work more efficiently by using a digital system that can handle more customers, track orders better, and make everything run smoother from taking orders to updating them. Each slide in the presentation highlights the different steps we followed and the features we designed to improve the customer experience and overall restaurant management.




Goal Setting – My timeline showed me how setting clear goals helped me stay on track, especially during busy times.

## 💭 Reflect

Each artefact represents a step forward in my personal and professional development:

Working in a group really pushed me out of my comfort zone. It helped me understand the importance of listening to others and taking responsibility. I also learned how to handle disagreements and stay focused on the goal.

One of the biggest things I’ve gained is the ability to recognise my own weaknesses. Through team discussions and feedback, I realised I needed to improve how I manage my time and speak up more in group settings. Knowing this helped me work on those areas and become more confident.

Reflecting on my experiences also helped me understand what I enjoy doing and what kind of work I want to do in the future. It’s made me more motivated and focused.

Overall, this process made me more aware of how I work, how I learn, and how I can keep improving — not just at uni, but also in the workplace.

## 🔗 Connect

This portfolio ties everything together into one cohesive story of growth:

When I look at all the artefacts together, I can clearly see how my skills and experiences link up. Each one connects to a part of my growth — from learning how to present myself professionally, to working better with others, and understanding my own strengths and weaknesses.

The resume and cover letter show that I’m preparing for the workplace. The teamwork project shows I can contribute to a group, communicate ideas, and handle challenges. The reflections helped me make sense of everything I’ve done, and the goals timeline connects it all by showing how I’ve moved forward step by step.

This portfolio brings everything together and tells my story. It shows not just what I’ve done, but who I’ve become along the way — someone more confident, self-aware, and ready to take on new challenges.

## 🧠 Conclusion
