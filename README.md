## 🎯 Select

The artefacts I chose show some of the key skills I’ve developed during my studies:

Communication – Creating professional documents like my resume, cover letter, and a comprehensive project report for "EntrepreNet" honed my ability to articulate complex ideas clearly. I learned to tailor my communication for different audiences, from writing technical project charters for stakeholders to presenting my own achievements to potential employers.

Teamwork & Leadership – The EntrepreNet project required me to define team roles and responsibilities using a RACI chart, ensuring clear accountability. This experience taught me how to structure collaboration effectively. I learned that successful teamwork relies on defined processes, mutual support, and shared ownership of deadlines to build trust and work efficiently.

Problem-Solving – My project report includes a detailed Risk Register and Quality Management Plan, showing my systematic approach to problem-solving. For EntrepreNet, I proactively identified potential issues like regulatory compliance and data breaches, and developed mitigation strategies. This reinforced that planning and structured analysis are essential for navigating complex challenges, whether in a software project or a team assignment.

Goal Setting & Project Planning – I created a full Project Schedule for EntrepreNet, including a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and an Agile Iteration Plan. This taught me how to break down a large, ambitious goal—like building a platform to verify SMEs—into manageable phases and sprints. This skill in setting clear, sequential goals was crucial for staying on track and managing my time during busy periods.

## 💭 Reflect

Each artefact represents a step forward in my personal and professional development:

The process of collaborating on these projects has been a significant catalyst for my personal and professional development. Stepping outside my comfort zone in a team setting was a profound learning experience. It taught me the critical importance of active listening, shared accountability, and navigating differing opinions constructively to maintain focus on our collective objectives.

A key takeaway from this journey has been the development of my self-awareness. Through open team discussions and constructive feedback, I gained a clearer perspective on areas for improvement, specifically in time management and assertive communication. Acknowledging these gaps allowed me to proactively address them, leading to increased confidence and a more substantial contribution to the team's efforts.

Furthermore, this period of reflection has been instrumental in clarifying my career aspirations. By evaluating what tasks I found most engaging and where my strengths were most effectively applied, I have gained a sharper focus on the professional path I wish to pursue, significantly boosting my motivation.

Overall, this holistic experience has enhanced my understanding of my own working style, learning preferences, and capacity for continuous improvement—a mindset I am eager to carry forward into my future career.
